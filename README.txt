1. The zipped file contains one folder which contains 3 folders : Code, Pseuodocode  and Output folders
2. The output folder contains the output file for Task-1 and the graphs for the Task-1
3. The folder named "Code" has 4 subfolders
    1. The folder Map-Reduce-Hadoop contains python scripts for pairs and stripes in Hadoop
    2. The folder Map-Reduce-Spark contains python scripts for pairs and stripes in Spark
    3. The folder Conditional Probability contains the python script for calculating the same in spark
    4. The folder Lift contains the python script to calculate lift
3. The folder named "Pseudocode" has 4 subfolders
    1. The folder Map-Reduce-Hadoop contains pseudocode for pairs and stripes in Hadoop
    2. The folder Map-Reduce-Spark contains pseudocode for pairs and stripes in Spark
    3. The folder Conditional Probability contains the pseudocode for the python script calculating the same in spark
    4. The folder Lift contains the pseudocode to calculate lift 

Conclusion: According to the graphs plotted for the runtimes for hadoop and spark for both pairs and stripes approach, it can be seen that stripes approach is more time-efficient than the pairs approach
